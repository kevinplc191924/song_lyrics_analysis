# Song lyrics analysis project
This project aimed to perform an analysis of the lyrics of 20 songs, for the artists Sin Bandera and Loveless. The process started with the data extraction, using the API from Genius. After some data cleaning, the analysis was done and its description and results are encountered in the `analysis` notebook.

- The notebooks `data_extraction` and `data_cleaning` also contain descriptions.
- The `my_functions` folder contains the functions used through each step and their documentation.
- The json file `emotion_lexicons` contains the labels (emotions) and words that describe them. It's a file used in `analysis` along with the `get_emotion_with_lexicons` function.
