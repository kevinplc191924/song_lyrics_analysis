## üìä Project Insights: Song Lyrics Analysis
This notebook explores the emotional and linguistic patterns embedded in song lyrics using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to uncover how sentiment, word choice, and thematic elements vary across different songs and artists.

## üîç Key Analytical Steps
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Lyrics are tokenized, lowercased, and stripped of stopwords to prepare for analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Each song is scored using VADER to assess emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, compound).
- Word Frequency and Visualization: Common words are visualized using bar plots and word clouds to highlight dominant themes.
- Emotion Mapping: Lyrics are mapped to emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and surprise using the NRC lexicon.
- Artist Comparison: Sentiment distributions are compared across artists to reveal style and emotional differences.

## üí° Notable Findings
- Songs with higher compound sentiment scores tend to use more emotionally charged vocabulary.
- Certain artists consistently lean toward specific emotional tones (melancholic vs. uplifting).
- Word clouds reveal recurring words that characterize the themes‚Äîlove, time, pain, and dreams‚Äîacross genres.

## üìÅ Structure and Reproducibility
- Modular code cells allow for easy adaptation to new datasets.
- Markdown commentary guides the reader through each analytical step.
- Visualizations are embedded for intuitive interpretation.
